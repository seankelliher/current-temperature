## Reflection

For geography, New England is a region in the Northeast United States. It is comprised of the states Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont. The National Weather Service (NWS) is our federal agency for weather. 

I wanted to build a component that pulls data from the NWS and displays the current temperature in each New England state capitol. Temperatures are displayed in both Fahrenheit and Celsius by default. Users can choose a preferred unit. If they do so, only that unit will display on this and future visits. The future visits part is done with local storage. Challenges for the project were deciphering the NWS's API and trying to make a list of temperatures look visually appealing.
